Active Preview provides a new preview link for users to click that creates a new preview window which is updated with changes in real-time.

== Description ==

This plugin provides the ability for users to preview a post or page and view in real-time 
the changes they are making to the page within the full context of their theme.

Please upgrade to version 1.2+ if the functionality is not working with your themes. We have updated the plugin to now work with every theme. Tell us if you still see issues.
